    * `http://[your-app-name-here].vercel.app/`

## Find your Bot ID:<a name="get-bot-id"></a>

Go here to view all of your bots:
https://dev.groupme.com/bots

Click on the one you just created.


On your Bot's page, copy the Bot ID


## Add your Bot ID to your Vercel app:

Go here to see all of your Heroku apps and select the one you just created before:

<!-- https://dashboard-next.heroku.com/apps -->


On your app page, click settings in the top navigation:


On your app's setting page, find the Config Vars section and click the Reveal Config Vars button:

Fill out the form to add an environment variable to your app:

  * In the "key" field type: BOT_ID
  * In the "value" field paste your Bot ID that you copied in the previous steps
  * Click the save button


## Now go test your bot!

Go to GroupMe and type "/cool guy" in the group where your bot lives to see it in action.


# Make it your own<a name="pull"></a>

## Pull the code to your local machine

Within terminal, change directory to the location where you would like the files to live, then run this command:

    $ git clone [GIT_REPO_NAME]

And then change directory into the new folder

    $ cd GIT_REPO_NAME

## Configure your local BOT_ID environment variable

Open the file `.env` from your local files in your text editor of choice.
Find where it says "YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE" and replace it with the ID of your new bot.

If you don't know what your Bot ID is, please refer back to [this](#get-bot-id) section,
where it is explained how to retrieve it.

If your Bot ID is 12345678910, then:

    BOT_ID="YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"

becomes:

    BOT_ID="12345678910"

## Start the server

To test your bot locally, open terminal and run the following command to start a local server.

    $ foreman start

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in a browser.


## All done! Go play around and make the bot your own.
